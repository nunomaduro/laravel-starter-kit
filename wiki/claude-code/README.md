## Overview

The Claude Code Super Wizard is an **interactive setup system** that transforms Claude Code into a project-specific AI assistant. Instead of generic responses, you get intelligent assistance tailored to:

- ‚úÖ Your exact Laravel version and packages
- ‚úÖ Your architectural patterns (Actions, Repositories, DDD, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Your team's coding standards and preferences
- ‚úÖ Your specific pain points and workflows
- ‚úÖ Your testing strategy and quality requirements

### Why Use This Setup?

**Without setup:**
- Claude Code gives generic Laravel advice
- Doesn't know your project structure
- Can't follow your team's conventions
- Might suggest outdated patterns
- Requires constant manual corrections

**With this setup:**
- Claude Code becomes a **project expert**
- Understands your exact architecture
- Follows YOUR coding standards automatically
- Uses version-specific features correctly
- Provides context-aware suggestions

---

## What's Included

The setup system creates a complete `.claude/` configuration directory with:

### 1. Core Configuration Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `config.yml` | Main project configuration and metadata |
| `guidelines.md` | Laravel Boost curated guidelines for Laravel 12 |
| `coding-standards.md` | Project-specific coding conventions |
| `rules.md` | Custom rules and forbidden practices |
| `project-context.md` | Auto-detected project information |

### 2. Specialized Agents

Intelligent sub-agents that handle specific development tasks:

| Agent | Specialization |
|-------|----------------|
| `backend-architect.md` | Laravel architecture, design patterns, database design |
| `testing-champion.md` | Pest testing, test generation, coverage optimization |
| `code-quality-enforcer.md` | PHPStan, Pint, Rector, quality standards |
| `performance-optimizer.md` | Query optimization, caching, scaling |
| `boilerplate-generator.md` | CRUD generation, scaffolding, repetitive tasks |
| `documentation-master.md` | PHPDoc, API docs, architecture documentation |

### 3. Custom Commands

Slash commands for common workflows:

| Command | What It Does |
|---------|--------------|
| `/new-feature [name]` | Scaffolds complete feature with tests |
| `/new-action [name]` | Creates Action class with validation |
| `/new-api [endpoint]` | Generates API endpoint with resources |
| `/fix-bug [description]` | Analyzes and fixes bugs systematically |
| `/optimize [feature]` | Identifies and resolves performance issues |
| `/quick-test [filter]` | Runs targeted tests with coverage |
| `/document [target]` | Generates comprehensive documentation |

### 4. Validators (Hooks)

Automated quality checks that run before tool execution:

| Validator | Checks |
|-----------|--------|
| `type-safety-check.sh` | Enforces 100% type coverage |
| `test-coverage-check.sh` | Validates test coverage requirements |
| `clean-code-check.sh` | Prevents code smells and anti-patterns |
| `inline-style-check.sh` | Blocks inline styles in components |

### 5. MCP Integration

**MCP (Model Context Protocol)** servers provide specialized capabilities:

| MCP Server | Capability |
|------------|------------|
| `laravel-boost` | Laravel-specific tools, Artisan integration, documentation search |
| `context7` | Code analysis, dependency mapping, module relationships |
| `sequential-thinking` | Problem decomposition, implementation planning |
| `herd` | Local service management (MySQL, Redis, etc.) |
| `notion-api` | Documentation synchronization |

---

## How It Works

The setup process follows a **5-phase interactive wizard**:

### Phase 1: MCP Verification & Installation

1. **Checks installed MCPs** - Verifies required MCP servers are available
2. **Detects project stack** - Analyzes `composer.json`, `package.json` to determine technology stack
3. **Shows installation commands** - Provides exact commands for missing MCPs
4. **Waits for confirmation** - Ensures MCPs are installed before continuing

**Example Output:**
```
=== MCP STATUS ===
‚úÖ context7 - Connected
‚úÖ sequential-thinking - Connected
‚ùå laravel-boost - Not found
‚úÖ herd - Connected

Missing MCPs detected. Install with:
npx @modelcontextprotocol/create-server laravel-boost

Have you installed the missing MCPs? [Y/n]:
```

### Phase 2: Project Analysis & Detection

1. **Scans existing configuration** - Checks if `.claude/` directory exists
2. **Auto-detects project patterns** - Identifies:
   - Architectural patterns (Actions, Repositories, Services)
   - Module structure
   - Testing framework and coverage
   - Frontend framework (Vue, React, Livewire)
   - API patterns
   - Event-driven architecture

**Example Output:**
```
Scanning project structure...
‚úì Found 16 modules (modular architecture)
‚úì Found Actions pattern in use
‚úì Found Event-driven communication
‚úì Found Repository pattern
‚úì Found 127 tests (Pest framework)
‚úì Found API resources pattern
‚úì Found Vue Composition API
‚úì Found Pinia stores
```

### Phase 3: Interactive Setup Wizard

**10-step questionnaire** that gathers:

1. **Project Discovery** - Name, purpose, stage, timeline
2. **Team & Workflow** - Team size, experience level, methodology
3. **Architecture Preferences** - Backend pattern, frontend approach, module communication
4. **Development Preferences** - Pain points, error handling, testing strategy
5. **Business Features** - Critical features, expected scale
6. **Integrations** - Payment providers, communication services, third-party APIs
7. **Code Style & Standards** - Code quality level, naming conventions
8. **AI Behavior** - Explanation depth, proactivity level, error handling
9. **Special Rules** - Absolute rules, forbidden practices
10. **Confirmation** - Review and approve generated configuration

**Example Questions:**
```
Q3.1: Backend architecture pattern?

1. Simple MVC (fast development)
2. Repository Pattern (abstraction)
3. Actions/Commands (single responsibility) [DETECTED IN YOUR CODE]
4. Domain-Driven Design (complex logic)
5. Service Layer (business separation)
6. Let me suggest based on project

Your choice [1-6]: 3

Q4.1: What slows you down most? (pick top 3)
[ ] Writing boilerplate code
[ ] Setting up new features
[x] Finding & fixing bugs
[x] Writing tests
[ ] Documentation
[x] Database design
[ ] API integration
[ ] Frontend/Backend sync
[ ] Performance optimization
[ ] DevOps/Deployment

Enter numbers (e.g., 1,3,5): 3,4,6
```

### Phase 4: Configuration Generation

Based on your answers, the wizard creates:

1. **Configuration files** with your preferences
2. **Specialized agents** tailored to your stack
3. **Custom commands** for your workflows
4. **Validators** enforcing your standards
5. **Optimizations** targeting your pain points

**Example Output:**
```
Creating your configuration...
‚úì Created .claude/config.yml
‚úì Created .claude/rules.md
‚úì Created .claude/agents/backend-specialist.md
‚úì Created .claude/agents/frontend-specialist.md
‚úì Created .claude/agents/testing-expert.md
‚úì Created .claude/commands/crud-generator.md
‚úì Created .claude/commands/api-endpoint.md
‚úì Created .claude/validators/code-style.sh
‚úì Created .claude/validators/module-check.sh
```

### Phase 5: Final Setup & Verification

1. **Tests configuration** - Validates all files are correct
2. **Verifies MCPs** - Ensures all MCPs are responsive
3. **Loads agents** - Confirms specialized agents are available
4. **Prepares commands** - Makes slash commands ready to use
5. **Provides next steps** - Recommends first action based on your project

**Example Output:**
```
Testing configuration...
‚úì All MCPs responding
‚úì Agents loaded successfully
‚úì Commands ready to use
‚úì Validators executable

## What Makes This Different?

### Traditional AI Code Assistants

```
You: "Create a new feature for managing products"

AI: "Sure! Here's a basic controller with CRUD methods..."
[Generates generic MVC code]
[Doesn't match your architecture]
[Misses your validation patterns]
[No tests included]
```

### With Claude Code Super Wizard

```
You: "/new-feature product-management"

Claude Code:
[Analyzes your codebase]
[Detects Actions pattern]
[Follows your naming conventions]

Creating product management feature...

‚úì Created app/Actions/Products/CreateProductAction.php
‚úì Created app/Http/Requests/CreateProductRequest.php
‚úì Created app/Http/Controllers/ProductController.php
‚úì Created tests/Unit/Actions/Products/CreateProductActionTest.php
‚úì Created tests/Feature/Http/ProductControllerTest.php
‚úì Created database/factories/ProductFactory.php
‚úì All files follow YOUR conventions
‚úì Tests achieve 100% coverage
‚úì Type safety enforced

Run: php artisan test --filter=Product
```
