# üöÄ Quick Start Guide

Get Claude Code configured for your Laravel project in **under 10 minutes**.

---

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

- ‚úÖ Claude Code installed
- ‚úÖ A Laravel project (this works with Laravel 11+ projects)
- ‚úÖ Node.js and npm installed
- ‚úÖ Basic familiarity with your project structure

---

## Step 1: Install Required MCPs (5 minutes)

MCPs (Model Context Protocol servers) extend Claude Code with specialized capabilities.

### Install Mandatory MCPs

```bash
# Install MCP CLI (if not already installed)
npm install -g @modelcontextprotocol/cli

# Install mandatory MCPs
npx @modelcontextprotocol/create-server context7
npx @modelcontextprotocol/create-server sequential-thinking
```

### Install Laravel-Specific MCP

```bash
# For Laravel projects (required)
npx @modelcontextprotocol/create-server laravel-boost
```

### Optional: Install Additional MCPs

```bash
# For Vue.js projects
npx @modelcontextprotocol/create-server vue-helper

# For documentation management
npx @modelcontextprotocol/create-server notion-api

# For E2E testing
npx @modelcontextprotocol/create-server playwright
```

### Verify Installation

After installation, restart Claude Code and verify MCPs are connected:

```
You can check MCP status by asking:
"Show me which MCPs are connected"

Expected response:
‚úÖ context7 - Connected
‚úÖ sequential-thinking - Connected
‚úÖ laravel-boost - Connected
```

## What Happens Next?

Once setup is complete, Claude Code becomes **project-aware**:

### ‚úÖ It Knows Your Project

```
You: "Create a new product feature"

Claude Code:
[Analyzes your architecture]
[Detects Actions pattern]
[Uses your naming conventions]

Creating product feature with:
- CreateProductAction
- UpdateProductAction
- DeleteProductAction
- CreateProductRequest
- UpdateProductRequest
- ProductController
- ProductFactory
- Tests with 100% coverage
```

### ‚úÖ It Follows Your Standards

```
You: "Add validation to the order form"

Claude Code:
[Uses FormRequest pattern]
[Follows your validation style]
[Includes custom error messages]
[Generates tests]
```

### ‚úÖ It Prevents Mistakes

```
You: "Query all users from the database"

Claude Code:
‚ö†Ô∏è Validation Failed:
You asked me to use DB:: facade, but your rules state:
"NEVER use DB:: facade, always use Eloquent"

I'll use User::query()->get() instead.
```

### ‚úÖ It Optimizes Your Workflow

```
You: "/new-feature checkout"

Claude Code:
[Creates complete checkout feature]
[Includes payment integration]
[Follows your architecture]
[Generates comprehensive tests]
[Documents the code]

‚úì Feature ready in 2 minutes (vs 45 minutes manually)
```

---

## Common First Commands

### Create a New Feature

```bash
/new-feature [name]

Example:
/new-feature product-reviews
```

### Fix a Bug

```bash
/fix-bug [description]

Example:
/fix-bug Shopping cart items disappearing after refresh
```

### Generate API Endpoint

```bash
/new-api [endpoint]

Example:
/new-api GET /api/v1/products
```

### Run Tests

```bash
/quick-test [filter]

Example:
/quick-test Product
```

### Optimize Performance

```bash
/optimize [feature]

Example:
/optimize product listing query
```

### Generate Documentation

```bash
/document [target]

Example:
/document CreateOrderAction
```

---

## Quick Tips

### üí° Ask for Explanations

```
You: "Why did you use an Action instead of a Controller?"

Claude Code:
Based on your architecture preferences (Actions pattern),
I'm creating single-responsibility Action classes for
business logic, keeping controllers thin. This matches
your existing codebase structure in app/Actions/.
```

### üí° Request Modifications

```
You: "Make that API endpoint return paginated results"

Claude Code:
[Adds pagination]
[Updates tests]
[Follows your API resource pattern]
```

### üí° Challenge Decisions

```
You: "Shouldn't we cache that query?"

Claude Code:
Great catch! Based on your expected scale (1K-10K users)
and your performance preferences, adding cache here makes
sense. Let me add Redis caching with a 1-hour TTL.
```

## Troubleshooting

### MCP Not Connected

```
Problem: laravel-boost shows as disconnected

Solution:
1. Restart Claude Code
2. If still failing, reinstall:
   npx @modelcontextprotocol/create-server laravel-boost
3. Check .mcp.json configuration
```

### Wizard Not Starting

```
Problem: Pasting setup command does nothing

Solution:
1. Ensure you copied the ENTIRE SETUP-PROJECT.md file
2. Try pasting in smaller chunks
3. Use /setup-project command if available
```

### Generated Code Doesn't Match Project

```
Problem: Claude generates MVC instead of Actions

Solution:
1. Re-run the wizard
2. Select option 3 (Actions pattern) in Q3.1
3. Check .claude/config.yml has correct architecture setting
```

### Commands Not Working

```
Problem: Slash commands like /new-feature not recognized

Solution:
1. Check .claude/commands/ directory exists
2. Restart Claude Code
3. Verify command files are .md format
```

---

## Next Steps

Now that setup is complete:

1. üìñ Read the [Complete Setup Guide](./SETUP-GUIDE.md) to understand how it works
2. ‚öôÔ∏è Explore [Configuration Options](./CONFIGURATION.md) to customize further
3. üìã Review [Rules & Guidelines](./RULES.md) to see what's enforced
4. üí° Check [Real Project Examples](./EXAMPLES.md) for inspiration
