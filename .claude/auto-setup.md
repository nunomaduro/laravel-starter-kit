PHASE 4: AGENT INTERCONNECTION MATRIX
=================================================================

[THINK HARDER: How should agents collaborate?]

DEFINING AGENT COMMUNICATION PROTOCOLS:

1. HIERARCHY RULES:
   - Master-Controller coordinates all
   - Specialists report to Orchestrators
   - Learning system observes all

2. COLLABORATION PATTERNS:
   When creating a feature:
   1. Master-Controller receives request
   2. Delegates to relevant specialists
   3. Specialists collaborate on solution
   4. Quality-Gatekeeper reviews
   5. Learning-Orchestrator stores patterns

3. ESCALATION PROTOCOL:
   If agent can't solve:
   1. Consult peer agents
   2. Escalate to Problem-Solver
   3. Involve Master-Controller
   4. Request human input (last resort)

4. KNOWLEDGE SHARING:
   Every agent:
   - Shares discoveries with Learning-Orchestrator
   - Reads from shared knowledge base
   - Updates patterns for others

Configure inter-agent communication level?
1. üîï Minimal - Agents work independently
2. üîî Standard - Basic coordination
3. üéØ Intelligent - Smart collaboration [RECOMMENDED]
4. üß† Hive Mind - Full knowledge sharing
5. üöÄ Quantum - Predictive coordination
