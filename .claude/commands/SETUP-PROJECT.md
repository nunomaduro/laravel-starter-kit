EXECUTE COMPLETE PROJECT SETUP

You are now my project configuration assistant. 
Execute these phases in order:

=================================================================
PHASE 1: MCP VERIFICATION & INSTALLATION
=================================================================

1.1 CHECK MCP STATUS:
    First, verify which MCPs are connected:
    - context7 (mandatory)
    - sequential-thinking (mandatory)  
    - memory-bank (mandatory)
    
    Show status like:
    ‚úÖ context7 - Connected
    ‚ùå sequential-thinking - Not found
    ‚úÖ memory-bank - Connected
    
1.2 DETECT PROJECT STACK:
    Check these files:
    - composer.json ‚Üí PHP/Laravel version
    - package.json ‚Üí Vue/React/Node version
    - requirements.txt ‚Üí Python/Django
    - Gemfile ‚Üí Ruby/Rails
    - go.mod ‚Üí Go
    
    Detected stack determines required MCPs:
    - Laravel ‚Üí need laravel-boost
    - Vue ‚Üí need vue-helper
    - React ‚Üí need react-helper
    - Testing framework ‚Üí need playwright
    
1.3 SHOW MCP INSTALLATION:
    If any MCPs missing, display:
```bash
    === MISSING MCPs - Install these first ===
    
    # Step 1: Install MCP CLI (if needed)
    npm install -g @modelcontextprotocol/cli
    
    # Step 2: Install mandatory MCPs
    npx @modelcontextprotocol/create-server context7
    npx @modelcontextprotocol/create-server sequential-thinking
    npx @modelcontextprotocol/create-server memory-bank
    
    # Step 3: Install stack-specific MCPs
    [Show based on detected stack]
    
    # For Laravel:
    npx @modelcontextprotocol/create-server laravel-boost
    
    # For Vue:
    npx @modelcontextprotocol/create-server vue-helper
    
    # For Vue + Shadcn:
    claude mcp add shadcn -- bunx -y @jpisnice/shadcn-ui-mcp-server \
      --framework vue \
      --github-api-key YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN
Then ask: "Have you installed the missing MCPs? [Y/n]: _"

If N: "Please install MCPs first, then run this command again."
If Y: Continue to Phase 2
=================================================================
PHASE 2: PROJECT ANALYSIS & DETECTION
2.1 CHECK EXISTING CONFIGURATION:
Look for .claude/ directory
If exists:
    === EXISTING CONFIGURATION FOUND ===
    Created: [date]
    Last updated: [date]
    
    Options:
    1. Use existing configuration
    2. Update configuration (keep as defaults)
    3. Start fresh (delete and recreate)
    
    Choose [1-3]: _
2.2 AUTO-DETECT PROJECT INFO:

    Scanning project structure...
